This is my training project for Python programming.
I'm creating a project that will use a variety of features to exercise many aspects of Python to include:
> Programming structures
> Some libraries like requests and json for the REST API call, and xlsxwriter for the ability to create and update an Excel spreadsheet
> Retrieve values from the API call
> Insert team logos into the spreadsheet

The output will be a spreadsheet that shows who each team is going to play for the week specified in the API call.
