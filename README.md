Practicing Python programming skills and creating aids to my Fantasy Hockey playing.
I'm creating a project that will use a variety of features to exercise many aspects of Python from a learning perspective. I created a project for myself to implement. The code could be written in a more efficient manor but that was not the intent. The intent was to use a lot of the aspects of the language in order to get more efficient with the language.

Project: To create a spreadsheet for a specified week that would show the game schedule for each team in the NHL. It would show the team, who they were playing, on what day and whether it was home or away. There would also be some additional features like showing how many games were being played for a day and for the week. This would use the NHL's API to retrieve the information, process the information and ultimately write it into an Excel spreadsheet.

Requirements: Include the following items (but not limited to):
 - Programming structures
 - Some libraries like requests and json for the REST API call, writing to a text file and xlsxwriter for the ability to create and update an Excel spreadsheet
 - Retrieve values from the API call
 - Insert team logos into the spreadsheet

Output: The output will be a spreadsheet that shows who each team is going to play for the week specified in the API call.

Since this was a self-defined project for training purposes, the following programming elements were implemented:
- Importing modules 
- Creating modules
- Class structure
- Methods
- if/else
- if/elif
- Working with text files - file operations
- for loop
- API call
- json structure
- lists
- tuple
- Dictionary
- Working with excel spreadsheets using openpyxl
- Date functions
- ranges
- variables
- enumerate
- while loop
- break
- exit
