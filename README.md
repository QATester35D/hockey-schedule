Usng Python programming to create an NHL hockey schedule for use in my Fantasy Hockey playing.

Project: To create a spreadsheet for a specified week that would show the game schedule for each team in the NHL. It would show the team, who they were playing, on what day and whether it was home or away. There would also be some additional features like showing how many games were being played for a day and for the week. This would use the NHL's API to retrieve the information, process the information and ultimately write it into an Excel spreadsheet.

Requirements: Include the following items (but not limited to):
 - Programming structures
 - Some libraries like requests and json for the REST API call, writing to a text file and xlsxwriter for the ability to create and update an Excel spreadsheet
 - Retrieve values from the API call
 - Insert team logos into the spreadsheet

Output: The output will be a spreadsheet that shows who each team is going to play for the week specified in the API call.
